Assignment 3 Write-Up

I'm fairly certain that I completed this assignment 100% of the way.  My main hurdle
in this assignment was actually obtaining the files from the MIC1 emulator that 
Prof. Moloney was nice enough to provide.  The other hurdle is that for some reason I
can no longer delete directories in my personal directory. Nevertheless, I've just been
moving all my trash files and folders into thusly named folder "trash". 

To execute my program you can either use the example format given in the assignment, 
./masm < Assignment3.asm > Assignment3.obj
./mic1 prom.dat Assignment3.obj 0 2048

or you could use my slightly more convenient makefile by typing 
make
